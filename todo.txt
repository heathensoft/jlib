Need an opengl struct in engine with version, limitations, compatibility / core.
Then query this when creating shaders and allocating buffers.
i.e. cannon use (#define version 460 core) when gl version is 4.3 or running on mac-os etc.






GUI:

* When rendering GUI elements, invisible id should be true by default. Or should it????
  We are rendering parent id's and transparent borders etc. might be fine to keep it false by default-
