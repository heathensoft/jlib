ENGINE:

Need an opengl struct in engine with version, limitations, compatibility / core.
Then query this when creating shaders and allocating buffers.
i.e. cannon use (#define version 460 core) when gl version is 4.3 or running on mac-os etc.






GUI:

[COMPLETE]
When rendering GUI elements, invisible id should be true by default. (COMPLETE)

[LOW PRIORITY]
When text wrapping is on, do not add a new line for a new paragraph. Treat the text
as one single paragraph. But, if the paragraph is empty we jump a line.
Reason: It looks better. Not sure after all.

[COMPLETE]
Drawing circles / ellipses in shader instead of using texture. (COMPLETE)

[LOW PRIORITY]
When control + up/down text field: add linked list to arraylist before searching?

Icon Window. (Not box Window) Closes when you click it or anything else. Icons for things like:
color pick, copy_paste etc.

Hover/descriptor window - single paragraph only. Temporary only for hovered. (not really a window) and NO_ID.
Singleton. Implement description interface? Maybe all interactables should. but can return null. Then no description-
Last thing to be drawn.

Text draw order
