ENGINE:

Need an opengl struct in engine with version, limitations, compatibility / core.
Then query this when creating shaders and allocating buffers.
i.e. cannon use (#define version 460 core) when gl version is 4.3 or running on mac-os etc.

Move reusable vectors etc. from MathLib to U


************************************************************************************************************************
IDEAS

masterwork items. ca. 1 of 20 (crafting crt) + 1 enchant slot + value

world map. placing a world map tile (like a tower, trees etc.) will determine the growing biomes algo for the tile.
And also for neighboring tiles.


************************************************************************************************************************
Tiles:

[Complete]
We Found the Tile Blend Texture Shaders in Texture.class.


************************************************************************************************************************
Shaders:

Add default blur, sharpen, bloom etc. shaders / passes:  Shader.bloomPass(texture)


************************************************************************************************************************
GUI:

File-cache: ctrl-f

Glow. Right now the glow shader data is really the threshold not the strength as i'd like it to be

Draw borders when rendering containers instead of boxes
Actually donÂ¨t. use a wrapper bow for border. BorderBox

[Complete]
I'm currently rendering space chars for strings. fix this.

Colored paragraph. Not necessary. Just have draw calls with color.

Rendering paragraphs

Rendering editable paragraphs

Scrollable BoxContainer.

System.out to debut text window

Remove Normal maps entirely from UI. Keep Glow. Leaves room for other functionality. like rendering lines. + more texture slots.
(Maybe not. When making actual game UI, it might be cool to have)

Delayed rendering. Render delayed commands. To be rendered after all windows. Used for dragged items and "help windows" (hovered descriptors)
Rendered without ID.

A gui class that stores textures generically generated. Like background from sprite etc. Loaded Textures too?.

[Complete]
box that can switch between content. only one is shown at a time. desired size is max of all


When querying color of words. Have a static variable of previous word,paragraph,font color???

FileCache.

[COMPLETE]
Named window boxes. Stored in window, accessed by key

[DISCARDED]
Split Box Containers (Necessary?) No.

[COMPLETE]
When rendering GUI elements, invisible id should be true by default. (COMPLETE)

[LOW PRIORITY]
When text wrapping is on, do not add a new line for a new paragraph. Treat the text
as one single paragraph. But, if the paragraph is empty we jump a line.
Reason: It looks better. Not sure after all.

[COMPLETE]
Drawing circles / ellipses in shader instead of using texture. (COMPLETE)

[LOW PRIORITY]
When control + up/down text field: add linked list to arraylist before searching?

Icon Window. (Not box Window) Closes when you click it or anything else. Icons for things like:
color pick, copy_paste etc.

Hover/descriptor window - single paragraph only. Temporary only for hovered. (not really a window) and NO_ID.
Singleton. Implement description interface? Maybe all interactables should. but can return null. Then no description-
Last thing to be drawn.

Text draw order
